Brew them with pour-over methods like Chemex or V60 to enjoy their bright acidity and delicate flavors â€“ perfect if you prefer coffee that's less bitter." },

Enjoyed black or with cream and sugar, it's the perfect bridge between light and dark roasts. Versatile and crowd-pleasing, it's a great starting point for coffee adventures." },

Expect a smooth taste with notes of dark chocolate, nuts, or smoke - perfect for espresso or strong coffee lovers. New to coffee and find lighter roasts too acidic? Try a dark roast!" },
