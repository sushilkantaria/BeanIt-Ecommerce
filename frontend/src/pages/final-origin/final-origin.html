      <p>Arabica coffee beans is one of the most popular types and it’s believed to be one of the first coffee species ever grown with roots dating back to 100 years. Known for their vibrant and complex flavours, these beans are loved by coffee connoisseurs because of their smooth and less acidic taste.</p>
      <p>There are two types of Arabica coffee bean, Typica and Bourbon. Typica is also sometimes known as Sumatra and Arabigo and it is this type which is thought to be the first bean ever discovered. Bourbon on the other hand is considered to be a natural mutation of Typica and offers a more balanced and slightly sweeter favour, making it a popular choice amongst coffee lovers.</p>
      <p>Robusta coffee boasts a distinct character in the coffee world. Native to Africa and now flourishing in Southeast Asia, these beans pack a powerful punch. Their flavor profile leans towards bold and intense, sometimes described as nutty or chocolatey, with a touch of sourness or bitterness. What Robusta truly excels in is caffeine content – nearly double that of Arabica beans! This makes them ideal for espresso blends, where they contribute a thick crema, and for instant coffee due to their affordability and robust flavor. Additionally, Robusta's resilience to pests and disease makes them easier to cultivate, allowing them to thrive at lower altitudes compared to Arabica beans. So, if you crave a strong cup with a bold kick, Robusta coffee beans are definitely worth exploring.</p>

    <h2>Why is coffee roasted?</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 30px; padding-right: 30px;">Roasting is the process of heating coffee beans to bring out the rich and aromatic flavour that we know and love. Fresh off the plant, coffee beans are actually green in colour and possess a grassy smell, then when they’re roasted, chemical changes occur as a result of the beans being brought to a high temperature very quickly. This change also causes them to turn into a deep brown colour with a wonderfully earthy smell. Once they’re roasted, they’re ready to be ground and brewed into your favourite blends.</p>
